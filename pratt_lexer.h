/*
 *  PrattScript - Dynamic Scripting Language & Pratt Parser Core
 *  -----------------------------------------------------------
 *  PrattScript is a lightweight, dynamically typed scripting language
 *  featuring first-class functions, arrays, objects, and garbage collection.
 *  Its core is a robust C99 implementation of Pratt's Top-Down Operator-Precedence
 *  parsing algorithm, supporting explicit binding-power rules, extensible syntax,
 *  and pluggable lexers and parse tables. The interpreter includes an arena allocator,
 *  string interning, and a mark-sweep garbage collector, making it suitable for
 *  embedding, rapid prototyping, and language research.
